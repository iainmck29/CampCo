# FULL STACK CAPSTONE PROJECT

## Camp & co by Iain McKenzie

In England, it is currently illegal to wild camp in the countryside however great amounts of land exist for potential tent dwellers to spend a night under the stars. Camp & co is a platform which allows landowners in England to register spots they have for wild camping and some basic details (toilets/electricty available etc.) for campers to view and get in contact with them should they wish to stay there. This brings a potential source of income to those with land to spare and that wild camping experience (without the illegality) to those would be woodsmen and women. Enjoy!

## Starting

Fork the project repo and clone it to your machine. The app uses a React Frontend and Flask backend. Further details for running this project locally can be found in the README's in Frontend and Backend respectively.

## About the Stack

### Backend

The backend directory contains a complete Flask and SQLAlchemy server. Authorization is set up using Auth0. The backend is currently set up to run on a local server.

### Frontend

The frontend directory contains a React framework built using the create-react-app starter code. The default routes for the frontend are to work with a local server. To change this simply change the url's to a chosen endpoint.
